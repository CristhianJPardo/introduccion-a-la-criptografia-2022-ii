            The SDES encryption algorithm produces an 8-bit block of plaintext (example: 10111101) and a 10-bit key as input and makes an 8-bit block of ciphertext as output. The S-DES decryption algorithm takes an 8-bit block of ciphertext and the same 10-bit key can develop that ciphertext as input and makes the initial 8-bit block of plaintext.
            In cryptography, the ElGamal encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange. It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985. ElGamal encryption is used in the free GNU Privacy Guard software, recent versions of PGP, and other cryptosystems. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a variant of the ElGamal signature scheme, which should not be confused with ElGamal encryption.

            ElGamal encryption can be defined over any cyclic group G, like multiplicative group of integers modulo n. Its security depends upon the difficulty of a certain problem in G related to computing discrete logarithms.
